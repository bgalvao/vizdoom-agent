# Reinforcement Learning Royale?

I don't really know what to call this project as of now, but unlike previous ones, this one is one I am passionate about. And I want to present cute graphics in a kawaii webpage and all that. The goal is to compare at least two algorithms:
- [ ] Distributed Deep Q-Network 
- [ ] Emergent Tangled Program Graphs ^1
- [ ] Neuroevolution

and common to all:
- [ ] use a [world model](https://worldmodels.github.io/), which to me is a dimensionality reduction.

In a first instance, these will be tested against a single environment, [ViZDoom](http://vizdoom.cs.put.edu.pl/). Some time later I'd love to do put these to the test and multi-task with OpenAI's Universe.


## Presentation

All shall be published in a webpage hosted by a branch of this repo. Planning on using [`bokeh`](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/).
